# Fan-Illusion
Welcome to the repository of Lynn's master's thesis in perceptual science! 

Supervised by Dr Suling Yeh, I explored the higher-level mechanisms behind a series of "motion capture" illusions. 

What are motion capture illusions?

# Demos

There are two types. 

The first type: stationary blades are "captured" by moving blades and seemly move.

The second type: moving blades are instead "captured" by stationary blades and seemly stop.

The second type, what I dubbed the "stop and go illusion," is a modification of the Stepping Feet illusion. Here it is in its radial form:

The mainstream explanation of the Stepping Feet illusion is low-level, focusing on the presence and detection of motion signals. I explored whether the illusion is in part caused by higher-level attention processes. The reason? Motion perception is not just a matter of detecting motion signals. In the absence of motion signals, we can still "track" and perceive an object as moving  (e.g., when a car is moving through a tunnel or when a rolling ball is temporarily occuluded by a tree trunk). I hypothesized that occlusion cues (or the lack thereof) are responsible for the phenomena above. These cues are required for for proper attentive tracking.
