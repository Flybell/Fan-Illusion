# Fan-Illusion
Welcome to the repository of Lynn's master's thesis in perceptual science! 

# Demos
Demos are written in PsychoPy & Python3. 

# Jupyter Notebook is STATIC! 
Still trying to create a Binder environment to host an interactive Jupyter notebook that can run the psychopy code. 

# See full experiment at the Pavlovia GitLab repository
The demos require the visual.RadialStim component to run. This component is still not available in PsychoJS, which means the demos cannot be executed directly via HTML (see documentation for current available components: https://psychopy.github.io/psychojs/). For your reference, I've hosted the PsychoPy experiment (and html output) on Pavlovia GitLab (https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/Flybell/fan-experiment).
