# Fan Illusions
Welcome to the repository of Lynn's master's thesis in perceptual science! 

Supervised by Dr Suling Yeh, I explored the higher-level mechanisms behind a series of "motion capture" illusions. 

What are motion capture illusions?

# Demos

The demos below consist of two "fans," each with multiple blades. 
One fan is stationary-- its blades are not moving. 
The other fan is rotating clockwise -- its blades are moving uniformaly. 

There are two types of motion capture illusions.

The first type: stationary blades are "captured" by moving blades and seemly move.

The second type: moving blades are instead "captured" by stationary blades and seemly stop.

The second type, what I dubbed the "stop and go illusion," is a modification of the Stepping Feet illusion. Here it is in its radial form:

# Explanation?

The mainstream explanation of the Stepping Feet illusion is low-level, focusing on the presence and detection of motion signals. I explored whether the illusion is in part caused by higher-level attention processes. The reason? Motion perception is not just a matter of detecting motion signals. 

In the absence of motion signals, we can still "track" and perceive an object as moving  (e.g., when a car is moving through a tunnel or when a rolling ball is temporarily occuluded by a tree trunk). The ability to track is highly contingent on the ability to attend to the object being tracked. When there are too many objects to track, attention load or capacity is depleted and the ability to track deteriorates. 

Occlusion cues are required for for proper attentive tracking. Leading and trailing edges are types of occlusion cues. I hypothesized that the above phenomena are the result of misplaced occlusion cues. Type 1: the leading and trailing edges of the moving blades are attributed to the stationary blades when they overlap.
